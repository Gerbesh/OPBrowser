# OPBrowser Code Slices

Last updated: 2026-10-05

A code slice is an end-to-end path through the architecture that produces one
observable capability. This prevents isolated subsystems from becoming impressive
piles of code that never form a browser.

## S0 - Native process startup

Status: COMPLETE at M0 level.

```text
op_browser::main
  -> Engine::start
  -> NativeBrowserWindow::create
  -> Win32 CreateWindowExW
  -> NativeBrowserWindow::run_message_loop
```

## S1 - Local/data document to pixels

Status: COMPLETE at initial M1 level.

```text
filesystem path / file: URL / data:text/html URL
  -> NetworkContext::load_document
  -> LoadedDocument
  -> Engine::navigate
  -> HTML tokenizer/tree builder
  -> DOM
  -> layout
  -> display list
  -> Win32 WM_PAINT/GDI
  -> pixels
```

Verified with examples\hello.html and data:text/html startup smoke tests.

## S2 - Navigation to static page

Status: COMPLETE for address-driven static HTML navigation.

Working core:

```text
Engine::navigate(request)
  -> load + render succeeds
  -> NavigationState::commit_navigation
  -> NavigationEntry

Engine::go_back / go_forward
  -> historical request
  -> reload source
  -> move current_index only after success

Engine::reload
  -> current historical request
  -> reload/render
  -> history unchanged
```

Implemented:

- navigation entries with original request, normalized address and MIME type
- current index
- can_go_back / can_go_forward
- back / forward
- reload
- forward-branch truncation after new navigation
- failed-navigation rollback by commit-after-success design

User-visible path:

```text
address Enter / hyperlink click / Go / Back / Forward / Reload / startup URL
  -> Win32 NavigationEvent
  -> op_browser command channel
  -> worker-owned Engine navigation
  -> op_net HTTP URL parser
  -> WinHTTP GET + TLS + redirect/framing/decompression
  -> bounded bytes -> BOM / charset / early meta -> owned decoding to Unicode
  -> own tokenizer/DOM/block text layout/display list
  -> result channel polled only during loading
  -> NativeBrowserWindow::present + status/address/history controls
  -> WM_PAINT/GDI pixels
```

Ctrl+L focuses/selects the address, F5 reloads, and wheel input scrolls. Failure
preserves the previous display list and history. Native button/Enter dispatch and
replacement painting have an automated Win32 test. Loopback HTTP tests cover GET,
redirects, cookie suppression, gzip, chunked bodies, status/MIME errors, size limits,
redirect loops, rendered text and history preservation after failed navigation,
back and reload. The asynchronous external HTTPS path is manually smoke-tested with
`--navigation-smoke-test https://example.com`; normal CI uses offline/local fixtures.

The hyperlink path preserves UTF-8 href spans through whitespace normalization,
nested inline labels and wrapping. GDI measures painted label bounds; hit testing
excludes ordinary text, toolbar and off-screen points, compensates for scrolling,
and clears stale regions after page replacement. Engine::follow_link uses the last
successful effective URL, including redirects during reload, before committing a
new history entry. Absolute HTTP(S), relative path/root/query/network references,
dot segments and local-file relatives are supported. The offline `--link-smoke-test`
clicks the first link in examples/navigation/index.html and paints its destination;
CI runs this with no external network dependency.

The text decoding slice now accepts Windows-1251/1252 and UTF-16 alongside UTF-8,
with BOM/transport/early-meta precedence. Common named and numeric references are
consumed in the tokenizer, so `&amp;` in hrefs becomes the actual query separator,
and escaped `<` remains text rather than becoming markup. Raw-text/RCDATA contexts
keep script/style source literal and decode references in title/textarea text.
HTTP regression fixtures and examples/encoding/windows-1251.html verify Cyrillic,
link metadata, loaded bytes -> pixels and subsequent link navigation in CI.

Limits: initial URL/encoding subsets; no CSS, images or scripts yet.
Links open in the current window. Fragment links reload the document without anchor
scrolling; HTML base elements, target/download behavior, the complete named-reference
table, other legacy encodings and full
WHATWG URL processing remain future work. Resizing moves controls but text reflow
occurs on next navigation.

## S3 - CSS-styled document

Status: PLANNED.

```text
HTML + linked/inline CSS
  -> HTML DOM
  -> CSS parser
  -> selector matching
  -> cascade/computed style
  -> layout
  -> paint
```

## S4 - Scripted page

Status: PLANNED.

```text
<script>
  -> op_js lexer/parser
  -> bytecode
  -> VM
  -> Web IDL bindings
  -> DOM mutation/events
  -> style/layout invalidation
  -> repaint
```

## S5 - Managed background tab

Status: PLANNED.

```text
browser tab
  -> lifecycle scoring
  -> throttle/freeze
  -> discard snapshot
  -> process/RAM release
  -> restore
```

## S6 - Native content blocking

Status: PLANNED.

```text
resource request
  -> request classification
  -> filter engine
  -> allow/block/redirect decision
  -> op_net
  -> page-visible result/statistics
```

## Rule

When adding a major feature, either extend an existing slice or add a new slice.
A subsystem is not considered product-progress until it participates in an end-to-end
slice.
